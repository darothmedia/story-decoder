# Story Decoder

## Description
Story Decoder is a shared story builder where each person contributes a sentence to a story, which is encoded in emojis. The story fragment is then sent to the next person in the group, who can only see the emojis submitted by the previous person. The story continues to be built with minimal collaboration, and is revealed at the end.
